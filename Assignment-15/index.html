      Rocky Mountain Montana is a land of high mountains, deep valleys, green forests, and treeless crest lines, whereas Great Plains Montana is a vast horizontal sweep of yellow rangeland, golden grain fields, and brown fallow strips.

         Archaeological evidence shows a human presence in Montana beginning about 7,000 years ago. Plains Indians began to arrive from the east in the 17th century, drawn westward by abundant migratory wildlife. At the beginning of the 19th century, the Crow occupied the south-central portion of present-day Montana, the Cheyenne the southeastern corner, the Assiniboin and Atsina (Gros Ventres of the Prairie) the northeastern corner, the Blackfoot the central and north-central area, and the Kutenai the northwestern corner. The Pend dâ€™Oreille had a territory around Flathead Lake, the Kalispell were in the mountains west of there, and the Flathead occupied the Clark Fork and Bitterroot valleys. The southwestern corner was disputed territory. After the westward expansion of the United States, the Flathead were forcibly moved to their present reservation in the Flathead valley. Most of the other tribes are now living on reservations within their respective territories.
