The universal selector will match any elements of any type. The element selector will match with any specific element name. The class selector will match any elements with a specific class attribute. The ID selector will match with any specific ID type. You may choose one over the other because some elements are better for style content.

My color pallette is based on Jeff Koon's 4 balloon dogs in that specific picture!
