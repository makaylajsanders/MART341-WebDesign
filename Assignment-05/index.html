      <i>The Giving Tree</i> is about a little boy who would visit a tree regularly, eat the apples, swing on the tree, and even nap in the shade. As the boy got older, he became to "old" to play around the tree. The tree tried to provide for the boy by giving him apples to make him money. As he got even older, the boy became to busy to play around the tree. The tree gave him some wood to build a house to fulfill his dreams. The boy became even older. He was sad. The tree gave him his trunk to build a boat far away from his town. He drifted away, but eventually came back. With just the trunk left, the tree gave the old boy a place to sit and rest.
