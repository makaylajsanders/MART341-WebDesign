A directory is a file system that contains references to other computer files or other directories.
Version control system is useful to see all the changes that were made. You can track your changes, revert back to old changes, and collaborate with others. 
My favorite kind of artistic medium is ink. I love watching documentaries with recovered documents, and all the old writings. It is very elegant.
