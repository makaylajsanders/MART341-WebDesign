When browsing the web, I will come across forms that ask for my contact information to stay up to date on potential sales. I rarely put in my information because this will likely make me spend more money. Other kinds of forms include, surveys. I don't particularly fill out surveys, but if I feel strongly enough about something, I will fill one out.
